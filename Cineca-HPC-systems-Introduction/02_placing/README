Exercise 2

1) Complete the first MPI exercise (MPI hello world) and compile it with the compiler mpiifort in the module intelmpi/2018--binary (default)
Find the exercise here: /galileo/home/userinternal/agrottes/Cineca-HPC-systems-Introduction

2) Check with:
$ ldd <executable>
the list of required dynamic libraries.

3) Write "job.sh" (you can copy it from exercise 1), asking for two nodes and modifying the --ntasks-per-node with the following requests:

#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=16
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=2
Run first 32 processes and then 4 processes for each select.
