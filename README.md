# Hands-on for Summer School 2019 - Rome edition 

To get the files open a terminal and clone the repository:

```
git clone https://gitlab.hpc.cineca.it/scai-training-rome/summer-school-2019.git
```

To update the content of the cloned folders during the school:
```
cd summer-school-2019
git pull
```

This will create the folder tree
```
summer-school-2019
summer-school-2019/GPU
summer-school-2019/...
```

Each subfolder contains **Hands-on** for the corresponding topic.
