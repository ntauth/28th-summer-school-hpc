# 28-th Summer School on Parallel Computing - Rome edition 2019 (1-12 July)

## Hands-on for Summer School

To get the files open a terminal and clone the repository:

```
git clone https://gitlab.hpc.cineca.it/training/summer-school-2019-rome.git
```

To update the content of the cloned folders during the school:
```
cd summer-school-2019
git pull
```

This will create the folder tree
```
summer-school-2019
summer-school-2019/GPU-programming
summer-school-2019/...
```

Each subfolder contains **Hands-on** for the corresponding topic.
